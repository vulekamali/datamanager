  description: Performance Expenditure Reviews (PERs) either assess baseline expenditure
    on existing programme or cost the implementation of a new or substantially changed
    policy. They include a policy and institutional analysis, a programme logic analysis,
    a key performance indicator analysis, and a cost and savings model.  These analysis
    involve the detailed scrutiny of programme performance and expenditure datasets
    to quantify, assess, and improve the cost effectiveness of public policy and public
    spending.

description: To enhance the quality of teaching and the outcomes of the basic education
  system, the national Department of Basic Education (DBE) developed a plan for the
  in-service training of teachers (INSET). The goal is to deepen their subject expertise
  as well as their pedagogical knowledge. The Integrated Strategic Planning Framework
  for Teacher Education and Development in South Africa emerged from extensive research
  and collaboration among a range of stakeholders, including provincial education
  departments, academics and teacher unions. It specifies what educators should know,
  and having established the nature of the gaps, identifies suitable institutions
  to provide the required training. The policy proposals are extensive and will require
  substantial public resources to implement.
