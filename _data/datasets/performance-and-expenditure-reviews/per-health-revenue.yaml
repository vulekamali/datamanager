  description: Performance Expenditure Reviews (PERs) either assess baseline expenditure
    on existing programme or cost the implementation of a new or substantially changed
    policy. They include a policy and institutional analysis, a programme logic analysis,
    a key performance indicator analysis, and a cost and savings model.  These analysis
    involve the detailed scrutiny of programme performance and expenditure datasets
    to quantify, assess, and improve the cost effectiveness of public policy and public
    spending.

description: 'This Performance and Expenditure Review (PER) aimed to address the issue
  of poor revenue collection rates at public health facilities in South Africa. To
  achieve this, a detailed understanding of the institutions and operational mandates
  that govern revenue management systems was developed. Revenue and expenditure on
  payment systems was estimated and then projected forward from 2017/2018 to 2021/2022
  in an expenditure and revenue costing model. An efficiencies and trade-offs model
  was then applied to these projections in order to identify the most efficient components
  of payment systems across the nine provinces. '
