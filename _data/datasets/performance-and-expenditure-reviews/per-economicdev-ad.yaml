  description: Performance Expenditure Reviews (PERs) either assess baseline expenditure
    on existing programme or cost the implementation of a new or substantially changed
    policy. They include a policy and institutional analysis, a programme logic analysis,
    a key performance indicator analysis, and a cost and savings model.  These analysis
    involve the detailed scrutiny of programme performance and expenditure datasets
    to quantify, assess, and improve the cost effectiveness of public policy and public
    spending.

description: There is wide agreement that South Africa produces too few artisans to
  meet the needs of the economy and that improving the efficiency and effectiveness
  of the artisan development system is important for accelerating growth and reducing
  unemployment. Indeed, the National Development Plan (NDP) sets a target of producing
  30 000 artisans a year by 2030, which would be more than double the number of artisans
  who graduated in 2013. (This was already considerably higher than the low point
  of 2005, when only 4 500 artisans graduated.)
