  description: Performance Expenditure Reviews (PERs) either assess baseline expenditure
    on existing programme or cost the implementation of a new or substantially changed
    policy. They include a policy and institutional analysis, a programme logic analysis,
    a key performance indicator analysis, and a cost and savings model.  These analysis
    involve the detailed scrutiny of programme performance and expenditure datasets
    to quantify, assess, and improve the cost effectiveness of public policy and public
    spending.

description: The main purpose of this performance and expenditure review (PER) was
  to understand how much is being spent on provincial roads, what drives this expenditure,
  and what is being delivered. The aim was to identify where spending might be inefficient,
  which could inform policy decisions and improve value for money. The PER aimed to
  analyse the unit cost per kilometre of provincial roads, taking into account the
  different costs structures across provinces due to topographical, climatic, soil
  and other differences.
