  description: Performance Expenditure Reviews (PERs) either assess baseline expenditure
    on existing programme or cost the implementation of a new or substantially changed
    policy. They include a policy and institutional analysis, a programme logic analysis,
    a key performance indicator analysis, and a cost and savings model.  These analysis
    involve the detailed scrutiny of programme performance and expenditure datasets
    to quantify, assess, and improve the cost effectiveness of public policy and public
    spending.

description: "The Micro Agricultural Financial Institutions of South Africa (MAFISA)\
  \ programme was launched as a pilot project in three provinces in 2004/05. Its goal\
  \ was to provide small, short- and medium-term loans to small-scale farmers to expand\
  \ production, particularly in communal land areas and on smallholdings with a variety\
  \ of tenure systems. MAFISA\u2019s approach was to channel funds appropriated to\
  \ the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) through the Land\
  \ Bank to established financial intermediaries who would make loans of up to R500\
  \ 000 to farmers. The programme\u2019s rules meant that the bulk of borrowed funds\
  \ were to be used to pay suppliers of agricultural equipment and other inputs. MAFISA\
  \ loan agreements stipulated that financial intermediaries generally would not pay\
  \ the borrowed funds to the beneficiary, but would pay the suppliers of approved\
  \ inputs and services directly.\u200B"
