  description: Performance Expenditure Reviews (PERs) either assess baseline expenditure
    on existing programme or cost the implementation of a new or substantially changed
    policy. They include a policy and institutional analysis, a programme logic analysis,
    a key performance indicator analysis, and a cost and savings model.  These analysis
    involve the detailed scrutiny of programme performance and expenditure datasets
    to quantify, assess, and improve the cost effectiveness of public policy and public
    spending.

  \ after the passage of the 1913 Land Act, and the Commission of Restitution of Land\
  \ Rights was established to undertake this process. Eligible claimants were given\
  \ three years from 1 May 1995 to lodge claims, which was later extended to 31 December\
  \ 1998. By that point, around 60 000 claims had been lodged, some of which were\
