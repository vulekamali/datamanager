  description: Performance Expenditure Reviews (PERs) either assess baseline expenditure
    on existing programme or cost the implementation of a new or substantially changed
    policy. They include a policy and institutional analysis, a programme logic analysis,
    a key performance indicator analysis, and a cost and savings model.  These analysis
    involve the detailed scrutiny of programme performance and expenditure datasets
    to quantify, assess, and improve the cost effectiveness of public policy and public
    spending.

description: 'The purpose of this study was to obtain relevant data and analyse the
  costs and revenues associated with provincial government renting state-owned residential
  properties to private tenants in the period 2013/14 to 2015/16.


  The key objectives of the project were to:


  - Identify and quantify all costs and revenues associated with the management of
  state-owned residential rental properties by provincial governments.

  - Assess the quality and comprehensiveness of available data on leases and rentals.

  - Estimate the discrepancy between rentals charged and market-related rates that
  could be obtained for similar properties.

  - Identify weaknesses in rent-collection systems and processes and make recommendations
  to address them.

  - Make recommendations to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of property rental
  processes.'
