  description: Performance Expenditure Reviews (PERs) either assess baseline expenditure
    on existing programme or cost the implementation of a new or substantially changed
    policy. They include a policy and institutional analysis, a programme logic analysis,
    a key performance indicator analysis, and a cost and savings model.  These analysis
    involve the detailed scrutiny of programme performance and expenditure datasets
    to quantify, assess, and improve the cost effectiveness of public policy and public
    spending.

description: "Provincial roads are a vital cog in the South African economy, and key\
  \ to ensuring access to social services. They are generally a high-use infrastructure,\

  \ does not wait for provincial road management systems to be in place or for budget\
  \ processes to run their course, with the costs of maintenance rising exponentially\
  \ with the deterioration of their condition. Furthermore, what happens in one section\
  \ of the network can dramatically affect other parts. If a stretch of road goes\
