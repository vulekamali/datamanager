intro: "A social audit is a community-led process that facilitates public participation\
  \ in the monitoring of government service delivery and expenditure.\r\n\r\nThis\
  \ guide is for community activists and organized civil society interested in conducting\
  \ social audits in South Africa. It aims to help these groups think about, conduct,\
  \ and reflect on social audits. The guide may also be of use to other stakeholders\
  \ (such as government) that want to better understand a process they may be requested\
  \ to participate in.\r\n\r\nThe guide can be used by civil society organizations\
  \ wishing to conduct a social audit, or adapted to train community members or civil\
  \ society organizations on the social audit methodology. It can also be given to\
  \ government officials or independent observers when requesting their participation\
  \ in a social audit process."
