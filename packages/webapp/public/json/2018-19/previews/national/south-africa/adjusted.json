Transport is a function that is legislated and executed at the national, provincial and local government levels. The implementation of transport functions at the national level takes place through public entities that are overseen by the department, each with a specific delivery mandate, as specified in legislation establishing these entities.\n\nThe 1996 White Paper on Transport defines the infrastructure and operations of rail, pipelines, roads, airports, harbours, and the intermodal operations of public transport and freight. The Department of Transport is responsible for the legislation and policies for all these sub-sectors. The department is therefore responsible for conducting sector research, formulating legislation and policy to set the strategic direction of sub-sectors, assigning responsibilities to public entities and other spheres of government, regulating through setting norms and standards, and monitoring implementation.\n\n","focus_areas":[{"slug":"community-development","title":"Community Development","url":"2018-19/focus/community-development"},{"slug":"economic-development","title":"Economic Development","url":"2018-19/focus/economic-development"}],"percentage_of_budget":3.9456727291873954,"programmes":[{"amount":430077000.0,"percentage":0.7186936208511104,"slug":"administration","title":"Administration"},{"amount":182253000.0,"percentage":0.30455957533413186,"slug":"civil-aviation","title":"Civil Aviation"},{"amount":10200000.0,"percentage":0.017045028989416608,"slug":"direct-charge-against-the-national-revenue-fund","title":"Direct Charge Against The National Revenue Fund"},{"amount":89982000.0,"percentage":0.15036723514957698,"slug":"integrated-transport-planning","title":"Integrated Transport Planning"},{"amount":119925000.0,"percentage":0.20040442172115555,"slug":"maritime-transport","title":"Maritime Transport"},{"amount":13023018000.0,"percentage":21.7625215038916,"slug":"public-transport","title":"Public Transport"},{"amount":15887279000.0,"percentage":26.5489344233284,"slug":"rail-transport","title":"Rail Transport"},{"amount":30098760000.0,"percentage":50.29747419073461,"slug":"road-transport","title":"Road Transport"}],"slug":"transport","title":"Transport","total":59841494000.0},{"description":"## Vote purpose\n\nEnsure the availability of water resources to facilitate equitable and sustainable socioeconomic development, and ensure universal access to water and sanitation services.\n\n## Mandate\n\nThe mandate of the Department of Water and Sanitation is set out in the National Water Act (1998) and the Water Services Act (1997).
