      ## Mandate


      The mandate of the Department of Tourism, as outlined in the Tourism Act

      (2014), is to promote growth and development of the tourism sector; promote

      quality tourism products and services; provide for the effective domestic and

      international marketing of South Africa as a tourist destination; enhance

      cooperation and coordination between all spheres of government in developing

      and managing tourism; and promote the practice of responsible tourism for the

      visitors.


      In recognition of tourism as a national priority, with a potential to

      contribute significantly to economic development, the 1996 White Paper on the

      Development and Promotion of Tourism in South Africa provides for the

      promotion of domestic and international tourism. The national tourism sector

      strategy provides a blueprint for the sector to meet the growth targets

      contained in the National Development Plan (NDP).

      _Lead the provision of an integrated, sustainable, reliable and safe transport

      system through planning, developing, coordinating, promoting and implementing

      transport policies, regulations and strategies._




      ## Mandate


      The Constitution identifies the legislative responsibilities of different

      spheres of government with regards to airports, road infrastructure, rail,

      maritime, road traffic management and public transport. Transport is a

      function that is legislated and executed at the national, provincial and local

      government levels. The implementation of transport functions at the national

      level takes place through public entities that are overseen by the department,

      each with a specific delivery mandate, as specified in legislation

      establishing these entities.


      The 1996 White Paper on Transport defines the infrastructure and operations
      of

      rail, pipelines, roads, airports, harbours, and the intermodal operations of

      public transport and freight. The Department of Transport is responsible for

      the legislation and policies for all these sub-sectors.


      The department is therefore responsible for conducting sector research,

      formulating legislation and policy to set the strategic direction of sub-

      sectors, assigning responsibilities to public entities and other spheres of

      government, regulating through setting norms and standards, and monitoring

      implementation.
