vulekamali Data Manager
=============

This app provides Single Sign-on (SSO) and support for maintaining correct and consistent data for the vulekamali Budget Data Portal by the National Treasury of South Africa.

Code Structure vision
---------------------

We're moving towards the following code structure:

    +-------+
    | views |
    +-------+
      |   |
      |   V
      | +-----------+
      | | summaries |
      | +-----------+
      |    |   |   |
      |    |   |   |
      V    V   |   V
    +--------+ |  +----------+          +------+
    | models | |  | datasets |---HTTP-->| CKAN |
    +--------+ |  +----------+          +------+
               |
               V
          +--------------+          +--------------+
          | openspending |---HTTP-->| OpenSpending |
          +--------------+          +--------------+

A lot of summary code has been implemented as part of models but should now
start moving to summaries, and just call out to models and datasets as needed.


Setting up Development environment
-----------------------

### Build frontend dependencies

First time, and any time dependencies might have changed

```
yarn
```

### Run JS and CSS incremental build for the assets managed by yarn (except webapp package)

```
yarn build:dev
```

### Build changes in webapp package

```
yarn build:webapp
```

### Start development server

```
docker-compose up db
```

Add the dokku remote to you local clone

```
git remote add dokku@treasury1.openup.org.za:budgetportal
```

Setup the database - either by running migrations against a new database, or by
loading a dump from elsewhere:

If you're setting up a new database:

```
docker-compose run --rm app python manage.py migrate
docker-compose run --rm app python manage.py loaddata development-first-user
```

Then run the server

```
docker-compose up
```

Now you can login with initial the *development superuser*:

Username: `admin@localhost`
Password: `password`

A fixture is needed to set this up instead of `createsuperuser` because Django Allauth is configured to require verified email addresses.

### Load data

Load an initial set of financial years, spheres and governments. You might need to add more recent ones manually in the admin interface.

You can download data from the production datamanager to use in your test environment as follows:

```
curl https://datamanager.vulekamali.gov.za/2018-19/national/departments.csv > departments-national-2018-19.csv
curl https://datamanager.vulekamali.gov.za/2018-19/provincial/departments.csv > departments-provincial-2018-19.csv
```

You can load this data into your environment with:

```
docker-compose run --rm app python manage.py loaddata video-language years-spheres-governments
docker-compose run --rm app python manage.py load_departments 2019-20 national departments-national-2018-19.csv
docker-compose run --rm app python manage.py load_departments 2019-20 provincial departments-provincial-2018-19.csv
```

### Development best practises

* Always maintain or improve test coverage
* Follow the principles of the [test pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html#TheTestPyramid)
* Put javascript into ``budgetportal/static/javascript/app.js``
* Put SCSS stylesheets into ``budgetportal/static/stylesheets/app.scss``
* Install new asset packs with Bower: ``bower install -Sp package-to-install``
* Get better debugging with ``python manage.py runserver_plus``

### Single Sign-on (SSO)

To use the Single Sign-on functionality in local development, make sure you set the relevant environment variables to match your local setup, e.g.

```
HTTP_PROTOCOL=http \
DISCOURSE_SSO_SECRET=... \
CKAN_SSO_URL=http://localhost/user/login \
EMAIL_HOST=localhost \
EMAIL_PORT=2525 \
EMAIL_USE_TLS= \
python manage.py runserver
```

Logout from ckan might not send you to the right URL to logout from DataManager. You can manually go to logout from this app at http://localhost:8000/accounts/logout/.

### Additional environment variables sometimes needing customisation for development

| Environment variable | Description |
| -------------------- | ------------|
| `DEBUG_CACHE`          | Enable the django app cache. Normally disabled by `DEBUG=True`, this enables it for development - see more in `settings.py`. |

Running tests
--------------

Install PhantomJS according to the right way for your operating system.

```
tox
```

This should should exist with non-zero status and indicate that all tests passed.

If any tests fail, the exit code will be non-zero and details will be printed to the console. Remember to scroll up a bit in the output to see stack traces corresponding server errors for HTTP-based tests.


Production deployment
---------------------

### Initial Deployment

You'll need:

* API key for a CKAN user who can modify datasets in the `national-treasury` organisation

Create and configure the app

```bash
dokku apps:create budgetportal
dokku config:set budgetportal DJANGO_DEBUG=false \
                              DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 \
                              DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=some-secret-key \
                              NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=cool app name \
                              NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=new relic license key \
                              CKAN_API_KEY=... \
                              DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... \
                              EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=... \
                              DISCOURSE_SSO_SECRET=... \
                              RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY=...
git push dokku master
dokku run python manage.py migrate
dokku run python manage.py createsuperuser
dokku ps:scale budgetportal worker=1
```

Also use `dokku domains` to configure the hostnames that your app will serve.

### Authentication

Apart from the superuser, additional users authenticate using either username+password or OAuth with social media accounts, e.g. Google and Facebook.

To enable this, we use [django-allauth](django-allauth) add social media account providers which provide verified email addresses in Django Admin's Social Accounts section.

For Google, set up an OAuth Client ID in [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?project=vulekamali)


Loading departments in bulk
---------------------------

The departments and their metadata are loaded using the Django Manage Command `load_departments`.

The command can be called to update the production database using

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...produser...:...prodpasswd...@proddbhost/budgetportal python manage.py load_departments 2018-19 national departments.csv
```

where

- `2018-19` is the financial year slug
- `national` is the sphere slug
- `departments.csv` is a CSV file as follows:

Required columns:

 - `government` - government name
 - `department_name`
 - `vote_number`

Optional columns:

 - `is_vote_primary` - TRUE or FALSE
 - `intro`
 - `website_url`

 [Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#header) must be used for formatting `intro`. e.g. 2 line breaks will result in new paragraphs. Use headings like `## Vote purpose`

 e.g. for national

 | government | department_name | vote_number | is_vote_primary | intro | website_url |
 |------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|-------|-------------|
| South Africa | The Presidency | 1 | TRUE | ## Vote purpose <br/><br/>Facilitate a common programme towards the ... <br/></br> ## Mandate <br/><br/>To serve the president in the execution of his ... | http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/ |
| South Africa | Centre for Public Service Innovation | 10 | FALSE | ## Vote purpose <br/><br/>Facilitate the unearthing, development and practical ...  <br/></br> ## Mandate <br/><br/> The responsibility for public sector innovation is vested in the Minister of Public Service... | www.cpsi.co.za |

e.g. for provincial

 | government | department_name | vote_number | is_vote_primary | intro | website_url |
 |------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|-------|-------------|
| Eastern Cape | Health | 3 | TRUE | ## Vision<br/><br/>A quality health service to the people of the ... <br/></br> ## Mission<br/><br/>To provide and ensure accessible comprehensive integrated ... <br/><br/> ## Core functions and responsibilities<br/><br/>The strategic objectives are in line with the implementation | |
