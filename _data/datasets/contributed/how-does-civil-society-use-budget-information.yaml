intro: "Mapping Fiscal Transparency Gaps and Needs in Developing Countries\r\n \r\n\
  Governments sometimes complain that the budget information they make publicly available\
  \ is seldom accessed and utilized. On the other hand, civil society organizations\
  \ (CSOs) often claim that the information governments make available is very difficult\
  \ to understand and not detailed enough to allow for meaningful analysis and advocacy.\
  \ Is there a mismatch between the budget information supplied by governments and\
  \ demand among civil society?\r\n\r\nThis paper examines the \u201Cdemand side\u201D\
  \ of fiscal transparency using findings from a global survey of 176 individuals\
  \ working in civil society that use budget information for analysis and advocacy\
  \ activities. Based on the responses, the authors identify a \u201Cfiscal transparency\
  \ effectiveness gap\u201D between the fiscal information that governments often\
  \ provide and the information that CSOs need.\r\n\r\nThese findings are used to\
  \ develop a set of recommendations to help governments ensure their transparency\
  \ practices deliver increased citizen engagement, improved oversight, and enhanced\
  \ accountability."
