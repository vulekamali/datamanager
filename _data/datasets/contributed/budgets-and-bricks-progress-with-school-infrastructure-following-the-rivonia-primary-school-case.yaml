intro: "The study, Budgets & Bricks: Progress with school infrastructure, explores\
  \ whether the Gauteng Department of Education's (GDE) promises in the Rivonia Primary\
  \ School, heard in the Constitutional Court in 2014, case have been met and whether\
  \ the GDEs plan on infrastructure is sufficient. The GDE was responsible for analysing\
  \ and providing for school infrastructure, but due to poor planning (primarily the\
  \ failure to account for future growth of learners) there were 20 000 learners without\
  \ a school place at the start of 2016. The report grapples with the question of\
  \ whether GDE's spending for 2015 is sufficient \u2013 and the task is hampered\
  \ by the fact that the available data is limited, and the data that is available\
  \ is problematic."
