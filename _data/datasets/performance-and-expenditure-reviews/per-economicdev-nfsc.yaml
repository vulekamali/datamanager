  description: Performance Expenditure Reviews (PERs) either assess baseline expenditure
    on existing programme or cost the implementation of a new or substantially changed
    policy. They include a policy and institutional analysis, a programme logic analysis,
    a key performance indicator analysis, and a cost and savings model.  These analysis
    involve the detailed scrutiny of programme performance and expenditure datasets
    to quantify, assess, and improve the cost effectiveness of public policy and public
    spending.

  \ interventions (e.g. vitamin supplementation, deworming, and nutrition education)\
  \ and complementary interventions (e.g. the provision of water, sanitation and income\
  \ support to indigent households). However, malnutrition remains a significant challenge.\
  \ The most recent data shows that one in four children aged 1\u20133 years are stunted,\
  \ which is higher than in countries with comparable levels of income. Malnutrition\
  \ contributes to the relatively high levels of sickness and death among children:\
  \ of the children who died before age 5 in 2008, more than 60% were underweight\
  \ and 30% were severely malnourished."
